Wobbly Standalone GLES2

To build the source code, run the build script:

./build

The dependencies are:

libpthread
x11
egl
glesv2
libpng

After compilation, run it:

./wobbly


The current implementation does not support maximize,
which is a significant portion of the original code base.
A different texture may be used by specifying with -texture.
Only png power-of-two images are supported.
