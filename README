Wobbly Standalone GLES2

Install the dependencies:

libpthread
x11
egl
glesv2
libpng

Build the source code:

$ make

Run it:

The current implementation does not support maximize,
which is a significant portion of the original code base.
A different texture may be used by specifying with -texture.
Only png power-of-two images are supported.
